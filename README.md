# Problem Statement
In today’s interconnected world, local intellectual property (IP) owners often find their IP vulnerable to exploitation on a global scale. Even when they register their IP **both domestically and internationally**, foreign entities **can still monetize** their creations without authorization. 

This issue has been seen in high-profile cases, such as the 2015 Apple and Qualcomm dispute over patent licensing, which spanned multiple countries, or the Havana Club rum controversy, where Bacardi violated Cubaexport’s IP rights due to the U.S. embargo.

The rise of digitalization has amplified these challenges. Artists, creators, and inventors now face the increasing threat of having their work exploited by international entities, **especially in the era of AI**. Digital art, music, and even patents and formulas are more susceptible than ever to unauthorized use. 

Complicating this is the tedious, complex process of traditional IP registration, which discourages many creators from securing protection. Even when IP is registered, domestic laws often fall short in offering global protection.

# **The Challenge: IP Protection in a Digital Age**
As the world moves deeper into digital transformation, artists, inventors, and creators across all fields—be it art, music, patents, or even proprietary formulas—need protection that goes beyond borders. Domestic laws can’t fully safeguard IP against international digital threats, and the traditional methods of IP registration are cumbersome, often outdated, and insufficient in this evolving landscape.

The growing influence of AI further exacerbates this issue. AI technologies can easily reproduce or adapt original work, making it difficult for creators to maintain ownership of their creations. Without a global system that integrates both physical and digital IP protection, **creators are left vulnerable to exploitation.**

# What is Story Protocol and how we build in it ecosystem?
Story is making the legal system for creative Intellectual Property (IP) more efficient by turning IP "programmable" on the blockchain. To do this, we have created Story Network: a purpose-built layer 1 blockchain where people or programs alike can license, remix, and monetize IP according to transparent terms set by creators themselves.

DeIP aims to leverage Story Protocol's IP infrastructure to bring traditional and Web2 off-chain IP users into the Web3 space, building an open ecosystem that links local creators with a global network. This initiative allows artists and creators from diverse backgrounds to connect easily with the international creative community. Additionally, DeIP provides a direct pathway to IP owners on Story Protocol, supporting the ethical commercialization of creative works. This framework is meticulously crafted to preserve the integrity and unique value of each artwork. Through this approach, DeIP fosters a secure, transparent, and sustainable environment for art to thrive.

# Phase 1: Introducing: DeIP – Fulfillment IP solution
## We help inventors protecting
DeIP offers a revolutionary solution by connecting physical IP registered under domestic law to Story Protocol, a global IP network designed through license module to safeguard intellectual property from the growing threats of digital infringement. By linking local IP with this global framework, creators can ensure that their work is protected on a worldwide scale, regardless of where the infringement occurs.

### Revenue Stream:
- Subscription protecting fee ( free for first 1 year)
- Litigation fees

## We help inventors commercializing
We have partnered with **KPMG**, a leading strategic partner, to provide expert support in the event of any legal disputes over our clients' IP. Through this collaboration, KPMG will bring to DeIP quality IP supplyDeIP can help creators defend their intellectual property rights and pursue legal action when necessary.

Additionally, DeIP introduces a tokenization model, allowing anyone to co-own their favorite characters or creations. This model enables fans and supporters to share in the revenue generated through the commercialization of the IP, making it more accessible and profitable for everyone involved. This is potentially become a first launchpad for IP, especially the character used to be a viral

### How this works:
- **Step 1**: IP owners sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with KPMG. KPMG conducts an IP valuation, provides strategic management, and, if needed, supports legal actions.
- **Step 2**: To strengthen IP protection and commercialization opportunities, KPMG transitions the MOU to DeIP.
- **Step 3**: DeIP assists IP owners in establishing their IP assets on the Story Protocol blockchain, supported by over $130 million in funding dedicated to specialized IP protection.
- **Step 4**: DeIP receives a digital private key for the IP, managing it on behalf of the IP owner. This arrangement allows IP owners to indirectly control their assets on-chain, benefiting from DeIP’s transparent and secure management system.
- **Step 5**: DeIP establishes a marketplace for IP, where businesses can easily request access to IP for commercialization purposes.
- **Steps 6-7**: If a business seeks copyright for commercialization (e.g., Netflix acquiring movie rights for characters listed in DeIP’s IP inventory), DeIP’s Launchpad tokenizes IP assets, enabling global communities to engage with and financially support the IP, thus participating in revenue sharing and partial ownership.
- **Step 8**: DeIP resells the commercialization rights of the IP assets it has acquired. Revenue-sharing arrangements then provide benefits to both IP owners and public investors from any commercial activities involving the IP.

**Party Benefits**
- **IP Owners**: Generate revenue by partnering with DeIP’s ecosystem, which connects with traditional sectors seeking IP access.
- **Public Investors**: Benefit from revenue sharing, increased IP valuation, and can support IP protection through DeIP Launchpad. They also gain opportunities to sell IP assets on the marketplace.
- **DeIP & Story Protocol**: Demonstrate the effectiveness of a global IP network ecosystem, fostering awareness and protection of IP assets.

### Revenue Stream
- Agreement arrangement fee and selling price gap
- Security fee (Fee for securitizing the IP)
- Revenue share haircut (1%)

## For Community - Grow hacking
Solana is growing rapidly, especially with the launch of Pump.fun and its unique "fair-launch meme" approach. This platform makes it easy for users to create meme tokens without fees, drawing in a wide range of people—from everyday users to artists. By removing the risk of scams, Pump.fun lets projects focus purely on building strong communities.

We've discovered that merging global IP with meme culture creates a powerful combination: it helps IP owners gain recognition within large, engaged communities, while allowing fans to support and protect these IPs. This is the vision of IP.FUN—a space where meme culture can flourish and support IP growth.

Our mission is to unite Web 2 and Web 3 audiences to back IP creators, helping their work reach more people while enabling fans to share in the revenue generated by these IPs.

This approach also boosts liquidity for both DeIP and the Story Protocol ecosystem, driving growth for everyone involved.
