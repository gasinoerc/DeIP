# Problem Statement
In today’s interconnected world, local intellectual property (IP) owners often find their IP vulnerable to exploitation on a global scale. Even when they register their IP **both domestically and internationally**, foreign entities **can still monetize** their creations without authorization. 

This issue has been seen in high-profile cases, such as the 2015 Apple and Qualcomm dispute over patent licensing, which spanned multiple countries, or the Havana Club rum controversy, where Bacardi violated Cubaexport’s IP rights due to the U.S. embargo.

The rise of digitalization has amplified these challenges. Artists, creators, and inventors now face the increasing threat of having their work exploited by international entities, **especially in the era of AI**. Digital art, music, and even patents and formulas are more susceptible than ever to unauthorized use. 

Complicating this is the tedious, complex process of traditional IP registration, which discourages many creators from securing protection. Even when IP is registered, domestic laws often fall short in offering global protection.

# **The Challenge: IP Protection in a Digital Age**
As the world moves deeper into digital transformation, artists, inventors, and creators across all fields—be it art, music, patents, or even proprietary formulas—need protection that goes beyond borders. Domestic laws can’t fully safeguard IP against international digital threats, and the traditional methods of IP registration are cumbersome, often outdated, and insufficient in this evolving landscape.

The growing influence of AI further exacerbates this issue. AI technologies can easily reproduce or adapt original work, making it difficult for creators to maintain ownership of their creations. Without a global system that integrates both physical and digital IP protection, **creators are left vulnerable to exploitation.**

# What is Story Protocol and how we build in it ecosystem?
Story is making the legal system for creative Intellectual Property (IP) more efficient by turning IP "programmable" on the blockchain. To do this, we have created Story Network: a purpose-built layer 1 blockchain where people or programs alike can license, remix, and monetize IP according to transparent terms set by creators themselves.
